# Learn Together - Developing Apps for Teams
# Digital Swag and Prizes

## Digital Swag

Let's get to the good stuff. What swag will be offered at this event and the foreseeable future? Glad you asked!

**Plant Trees to Benefit the Enviroment and Local Economies**

Every email, livestream, and action emits carbon and our goal is to be net-zero carbon neutral. Transparency is key and the Microsoft Developer Relations Event Team is still learning, but we are prioritizing sustainability efforts for our digital experiences. We have partnered with [Ecosia](https://info.ecosia.org/about), a search engine that plants trees for every search. 

Additionally, this event specifically has gifted 960 trees to tackle climate change. You can add the [Ecosia extension](https://www.ecosia.org/) to your selected browser and visit the [Ecosia Pop-Up store](https://plant.ecosia.org/) to give and gift more trees!

**Tech Stretch**

I do not know about you, but I need to get up from my chair, couch, stool and stretch my legs! This tech stretch one-pager is great for taking a quick break from the screen and prioritizing your wellbeing with our guided stretches. [Download and stretch](https://github.com/microsoft/learntogether-devappsforteams/blob/main/Tech%20Stretch.jpg) now, later, or daily!

**Teams Background Downloads & Digital Stickers**

Enter your next meeting with a creative and fun background. [Download these free Microsoft Teams backgrounds](https://github.com/microsoft/learntogether-devappsforteams/blob/main/Teams%20Backgrounds.zip) and use whenever you would like. Check out the trees and river one since we are planting trees with this event! Oh, and the Bit racoon with the Teams t-shirt digital sticker!

**VS Code Theme**

**Digital Kids Pack**

Keeping children engaged is now essential as part of an Events Best Practice. As guardians and self proclaimed coloring and puzzle professionals, we get it. The [Kids Activity Pack](https://workbooks.aaron-powell.com/?WT.mc_id=learntogether_M365-workbooks-cxa) will entertain anyone from 0 to 99 years old, while you attend the event and anytime after. 

No printer and do not want the paper to go to waste? Not a problem! The activity pack is accessible [digitally](https://workbooks.aaron-powell.com/?WT.mc_id=learntogether_M365-workbooks-cxa) to use on any devise!
